# Mankind Project Japan
Tokyo men’s circle is part of The Mankind Project which supports men in finding their authentic selves and living their mission in the world.

Some of the men in the Tokyo circle have attended a weekend experiential training called New Warrior Training Adventure. The weekend training is normally a prerequisite for sitting in circle, but there are no trainings in Japan, so we are open to new men coming to sit with us.

Everything spoken in the circle is confidential within the circle.

If you attend, you will have a chance to speak about any issue that is challenging in your life, and have a chance to feel some of the emotions that are (possibly lurking) behind the challenge. All emotions are welcome; we create a safe space for men to speak.
